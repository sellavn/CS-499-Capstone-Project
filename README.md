## Project Overview

This repository contains my capstone project demonstrating skills across three key computer science domains:

1. **Software Engineering & Design** - Porting a C++ course planner to a professional Python CLI tool

2. **Algorithms & Data Structures** - Optimizing with hash maps and implementing graph algorithms

3. **Databases** - Integrating SQLite with advanced features and data migration

## Repository structure

- `original-artifacts/` - Original code from CS-300 and CS-360

- `code-review/` - Code review presentation and analysis (Milestone 1)

- `enhancement-one/` - Category 1: Software Engineering & Design

- `enhancement-two/` - Category 2: Algorithms & Data Structures

- `enhancement-three/` - Category 3: Databases

-`docs/` - All written deliverables and narratives

## Planned Enhancements Summary

### Category 1: Software Engineering & Design

- Port C++ application to Python

- Implemented professional CLI using argparse

- Created modular architecture with dataclasses

- Added configuration file support and logging

### Category 2: Algorithms & Data Structures

- Implement hash map indexing for O(1) course lookups

- Added prerequisite validation using DFS

- Performance benchmarking showing improvements

### Category 3: Databases

- Repurpose and implement SQLite schema with many-to-many relationships

- Implement transaction-based CSV to database migration

- Add parameterized queries for security

- Optimize with indexes and JOIN queries
